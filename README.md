## Projects

### Assessing mtDNA Variation and Cognitive Function Midlife

**Code:** [CARDIA mtDNA Github](https://github.com/AndrewsLabUCSF/mtDNAhtz_CARDIA)

**Goal:** To assess if mitochondrial heteroplasmy (mtHz) bruden or haplogroups (mtHg) are associated with cognitive performance in a multiracial midlife cohort

**Description:**

We analyzed the association between mtHz and mtHg with cognitive performance in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing data was processed through a Nextflow pipeline with custom Bash script. Associations were analyzed using linear regression and linear mixed models in R. We implemented linear regression models to assess the cross-sectional associations between mtHz and mtHg with z-standardized cognitive performance, adjusting for education, race, age, and sex. Longitudinal analysis was conducted using linear mixed models. Sensitivity analyses, additionally adjusting for social determinants of health (SDOH) or *APOE Îµ4,* lifestyle variables, and comorbidities were conducted to test the robustness of our findings.

**Skills:** bash scripting, data analysis, hypothesis testing, post-hoc testing, sensitivity tests, data visualization

**Technology:** nextflow pipeline, dyplr, ggplot, lm, lmer, effects, glht

**Results:** mtHg, not mtHz, is associated with cognitive function at midlife. Results remained robust in sensitivity analysis.

### Model Comparison of Coronary Heart Disease Risk Prediction from Nation-Wide Survey

**Code:** Model_Comparison.Rmd

**Goal:** Create a cost-effective and personalized machine learning model for predicting coronary heart disease (CHD) risk using non-clinical data

**Description:**

This project aims to predict coronary heart disease (CHD) risk using data from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. Key risk factors for CHD, including demographic, socioeconomic, health, and behavioral variables, were used to build predictive models. The project focused on balancing the dataset and applying machine learning techniques such as decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost to improve prediction accuracy and interpretability.

**Skills:** machine learning, model comparison, metrics calculation from confusion matrix, data visualization

**Technology:** dyplr, ,table1, rpart, ranger, caret, xgboost, rocit, ciAUC, kable, ggplot

**Results:**

-   XGBoost was identified as the best-performing model, with \~75.4% accuracy, 73.5 % precision, 79.5% recall and 76.3% F1-score. Recall was the the most crucial metric, indicating its potential as a pre-clinical screening model for early CHD risk detection and intervention.

-   Feature importance analysis showed that age, hypertension, and employment were among the most important predictors across models.
